Look at the increasing chasm between China and India GDP.

      <title>Negative side of Social Networking</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The world of social networking is catching very fast with the real world. Having water cooler talk is pretty normal but hear this now. I was getting ready for a welcome party for a baby and like any self respecting geek I asked Ms Beta Thoughts &amp;#8211; hey I like this white shirt what do you think? Umm&amp;#8230; didn&amp;#8217;t you wear this when we went to Santa Cruz boardwalk, and we uploaded the photos so every one has seen this. Wear a different one.. Oh nooo&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hindi on G1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Am I the only one who care about seeing Hindi on G1 phone? So far the big search company has been very good for Hindi. Alok would attest that. But for whatever reason Hindi, still shows as boxes on Google. I was hoping the cupcake release would have that but not yet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Airtel Call Home Misleading 1 cent campaign</title>
      <link>https://pnarula.com/2009/airtel-call-home-misleading-1-cent-campaign/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Apr 2009 22:46:13 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://pnarula.com/2009/airtel-call-home-misleading-1-cent-campaign/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;First a little background &amp;#8211; I have used Airtel Call Home for calling India in the past and generally like their voice quality. They had also ran great introductory offers when they started which gave good run for the money to Reliance India Call &amp;#8211; gold standard in India calling. Competition has been good in this market and has pushed the prices down considering it used to be 65-70 cents a minute when I came to US in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to Airtel&amp;#8217;s recent claim of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.airtelcallhome.com/ics_war/ics.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;#038;_pageLabel=pages_specialOffer_page&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;https://www.airtelcallhome.com/ics_war/ics.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;#038;_pageLabel=pages_specialOffer_page&#39;, &#39;1 cents / minute call&#39;]);&#34; &gt;1 cents / minute call&lt;/a&gt;. How would you feel if you went to a shop for buying a pair of shoes and saw on display &amp;#8220;Shoes for only $100&amp;#8221; but later on realize the shoes are infact 66 % more i.e. they are really $166 not $100. This is what Airtel is doing with their 1 cents a minute promotion. Best is the use of phrase like &amp;#8220;Rental Value&amp;#8221;. If I buy a card for $10, $3.99 is deducted to provide &amp;#8220;Rental Value&amp;#8221; I wonder what value does the customer drives from this. Why did they choose to rephrase a charge as value. Is customer that dumb. And what was wrong with selling minutes for 1.66 cents per minute? It is still the lowest price I have seen in the Tier 1 India Calling card business and is half the price of what I am paying right now. By trying to mislead customers Airtel is not gonna earn TLC from customers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Good SOA Analogy</title>
      <link>https://pnarula.com/2008/a-good-soa-analogy/</link>

      <guid>https://pnarula.com/2008/a-good-soa-analogy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thomas Otter was &lt;a href=&#34;http://theotherthomasotter.wordpress.com/2008/11/03/soa-laptops-and-coffee/&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://theotherthomasotter.wordpress.com/2008/11/03/soa-laptops-and-coffee/&#39;, &#39;mulling over&#39;]);&#34; &gt;mulling over&lt;/a&gt; how analogies are a great tool in &lt;a href=&#34;http://pnarula.com/200811/internalize/&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://pnarula.com/200811/internalize/&#39;, &#39;internalizing&#39;]);&#34; &gt;internalizing&lt;/a&gt; new concepts like SOA. His analogy of pointing the difference between a laptop/notebook and Desktop is a good one and points to the loosely coupled and tightly coupled systems. There is another analogy I really like and I believe is a good one in explaining SOA to someone. It comes from &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.sun.com/bernard/entry/soa_boa&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://blogs.sun.com/bernard/entry/soa_boa&#39;, &#39;Bernard Wheeler&#39;]);&#34; &gt;Bernard Wheeler&lt;/a&gt; at Sun. Here it is in its entirety&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional relationship between business and IT is like having a personal chef: you (the business) can dictate what you want to eat, or take menu recommendations, but your chef (the IT department) only buys supplies according to the pre-agreed menu. You play no part in how the food is bought, cooked, etc., but you pay the whole cost for the chef, cooking fuel, food and all the waste from each meal. In addition, if you suddenly change your mind about what you want to eat, there&amp;#8217;s unlikely to be an alternative meal ready in a short time &amp;#8211; apart from re-cooked leftovers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using commodity-off-the-shelf (COTS) software is more like eating in a restaurant: there&amp;#8217;s typically less flexibility available to you in the actual make-up of the dishes and the more customization you want, the more it&amp;#8217;ll cost. But you share the costs of the chef, facilities, etc. among other restaurant-goers &amp;#8211; reaping some benefits from the &amp;#8216;economies of scale&amp;#8217; of the restaurant. Furthermore, if you change your mind about what you want just before ordering (e.g. pizza vs. pasta), there&amp;#8217;s probably a reasonable alternative that can be available in an acceptable amount of time. But if you want to include a totally different culture or flavor (e.g. vegetable tempura as a starter), you may have to visit more than one &amp;#8216;restaurant&amp;#8217; and figure out for yourself the logistics of how the &amp;#8216;meal&amp;#8217; as a whole is going to be achieved. Also, there&amp;#8217;s nothing to stop the restaurant from suddenly hiking up their prices, radically changing their menu, or being bought out by a bigger chain who then &amp;#8216;trashes&amp;#8217; your preferred meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOA is like eating at a buffet: the chef (either private or shared) prepares a range of dishes from which &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; build &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;your own&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; meal. The meal you choose does not require the whole ensemble to be put together &amp;#8216;in the kitchen&amp;#8217;: rather, the chef focuses solely on ensuring that there is an appropriate range of dishes provided in the buffet to keep most people happy for most of the time, based on market demand, season (and other prevailing conditions), consumer feedback/requests/suggestions, etc. And if the cost of any item changes dramatically (or there&amp;#8217;s an ingredient shortage, &amp;ldquo;food scare&amp;rdquo;, or some other reason to change a menu choice), you don&amp;#8217;t have to change your whole meal, just that one piece of it (although granted, it may be the centrepiece of the meal).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>People want to connect</title>
      <link>https://pnarula.com/2008/people-want-to-connect/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;All of us have seen the rise of social software wave in the last few years. If I were to put these software on human life scale &amp;#8211; wikis and forums would be the oldies, blogs the middle age folks, FaceBook-Myspace-Orkut-LinkedIn as the young adults and twitter, friendfeed as the teens. The underlying human behavior for the success of everything social on internet is greatly summarized by Clay Shirky in his book &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Here-Comes-Everybody-Organizing-Organizations/dp/1594201536&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://www.amazon.com/Here-Comes-Everybody-Organizing-Organizations/dp/1594201536&#39;, &#39;&amp;#8220;Here Comes Everybody&amp;#8221;&#39;]);&#34; &gt;&amp;#8220;Here Comes Everybody&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human beings are social creatures &amp;#8211; not occasionally or by accident but always. Sociability is one of our core capabilities, and it shows up in almost every aspect of our lives as both cause and effect. Society is not just the product of its individual members; it is also the product of its constituent groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar views were echoed by Seth Godin in this &lt;a href=&#34;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/10/leadership-is-n.html&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/10/leadership-is-n.html&#39;, &#39;post&#39;]);&#34; &gt;post&lt;/a&gt; where he said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s so tempting to believe that we are merely broadcasters, putting together a play list and hurtling it out to the rest of the world. Louder is better. But we&amp;#8217;re not. Now we&amp;#8217;re leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People want to connect.&lt;/strong&gt; They want you to do the connecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Over the years I have realized that it takes quite a long time for ideas to &amp;#8220;really&amp;#8221; sink in. You might read a book on behavioral economics and really like the ideas and various biases presented in it and say wow that is cool. But unless the idea is internalized you will probably forget it. It would be akin knowing a word and its dictionary meaning but never use it in conversations. It is only after you have read the same idea again and again in various contexts, have discussed about it with your peers, friends etc that the ideas are absorbed. Some of the ideas that have taken time for me our opportunity cost, time value of money and the one pertaining to my profession IT is enabler of business or a tool if you would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What ideas do you have that took time to sink in?&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://pnarula.com/2008/dr-krugman-wins-noble/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years I have grown fond of economics. I stumbled across Brad deLong&amp;#8217;s blog and started reading some stuff about economics. Then I read &lt;a title=&#34;The Great Unravling by Paul Krugman&#34; href=&#34;http://http//pnarula.com/200410/the-great-unraveling-by-paul-krugman/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;The Great Unraveling&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; and it was a pleasure to read the ways Dr. Krugman explained some of the concepts using simple models. For the last few months I have been reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/&#39;, &#39;his blog&#39;]);&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;his blog&lt;/a&gt; at NYTimes and it has been very very informative. So when I read on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/10/paul-krugman-wi.html&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/10/paul-krugman-wi.html&#39;, &#39;Marginal Revolution&#39;]);&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Marginal Revolution&lt;/a&gt; this morning that Dr. Krugman has won this year&amp;#8217;s Noble&amp;#8217;s prize for economics, I said WOW..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many many congrats to Dr. Krugman on the much deserved prize.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the twenty or so must read books mentioned in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.poorcharliesalmanack.com/index.html&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://www.poorcharliesalmanack.com/index.html&#39;, &#39;Poor Charlie&amp;#8217;s Almanac&#39;]);&#34; &gt;Poor Charlie&amp;#8217;s Almanac&lt;/a&gt; is &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Yes-Negotiating-Agreement-Without/dp/0140157352&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Yes-Negotiating-Agreement-Without/dp/0140157352&#39;, &#39;Getting to Yes&#39;]);&#34; &gt;Getting to Yes&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; a principled approach to negotiations. It is an excellent and accessible read on getting to mutually agreeable outcome during negotiations ranging from salary to nuclear disarmament talks. For my present gig I commute between South San Francisco and San Jose on a not-so-enjoyable highway 101. Listening to books is a great way to utilize this time. In the book authors point out that one of the mistake parties make during the negotiation is just thinking about one&amp;#8217;s own positions. Parties overlook the fact that the folks on the other side of table are humans too. Focusing on the basic human needs of security, appreciation, well being etc. would result in successful results for all parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While keeping the human nature in focus during negotiation is definitely fruitful, but I think this principle can be applied in general to a lot more situations. Especially while talking to people in authority. For example students can keep this in mind while talking to professors. Most of the time students would be focused on their own world and think professors are this abstract entities who are after their life giving assignments, asking them to review and re-review their assignments. Same goes for employees towards their managers etc. How many times any one thinks that professors or managers may have a life too. With loving wife and kids may be a dog too. Focusing on the human side of authorities would result in better and cordial relations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After many many years I have started reading a novel based on the true story of author &amp;#8211; Shantaram. I am on the 11th page and I love it. Here is a blurb about Bombay&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bullock cart was drawn up beside a modern sports car at a traffic signal. A man squatted to relieve himself behind the discreet shelter of a satellite dish. An electric forklift truck was being used to unload goods from an ancient wooden cart with wooden wheels. The impression was of a ploding, indefatigable, and distant past that had crashed intact through barriers of time, into its own future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little be dramatic but about right for any large city in India.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Few days back I was at Project Management training and our excellent instructor asked what is the problem executives are trying to solve by going for ERP implementation. What he said rhymed with some thing Jeff Nolan wrote today on &lt;a href=&#34;http://future.gigaom.com/2007/09/19/what-is-the-future-of-enterprise-software/&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://future.gigaom.com/2007/09/19/what-is-the-future-of-enterprise-software/&#39;, &#39;Future of Enterprise Software&#39;]);&#34; &gt;Future of Enterprise Software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEOs are concerned about growing their businesses in an era of increasing uncertainty and efficiency demands; business managers need real-time visibility for intra- and inter-company events, as well as the ability to reconfigure processes with increasing frequency; the CFO, meanwhile, has to ensure regulatory compliance and business integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the CIO, these challenges come at time when maintenance costs are rising and the number of trusted partners are shrinking â€” systems remain undiminished, yet there are fewer vendors capable of supporting large-enterprise customers. We are down to less than 200 publicly traded tech providers from over 400 in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Jeff for penning these thoughts and &lt;a href=&#34;http://gigaom.com&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://gigaom.com&#39;, &#39;Om Malik&#39;]);&#34; &gt;Om Malik&lt;/a&gt; for bringing all the folks writing thoughts on &lt;a href=&#34;http://future.gigaom.com&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://future.gigaom.com&#39;, &#39;future&#39;]);&#34; &gt;future&lt;/a&gt; of software.&lt;/p&gt;
