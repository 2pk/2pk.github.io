      <title>Advice on joining the SAP world</title>
      <link>https://2pk.github.io/2007/11/advice-on-joining-the-sap-world/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Nov 2007 23:05:45 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://2pk.github.io/2007/11/advice-on-joining-the-sap-world/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having been in SAP for some years I get asked this question how to get into SAP as a career. I was writing this to a close friend of mine and thought of putting it on the blog. This advice is a rather first step to decide which stream to join in SAP &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology Consulting&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; understanding the architecture of various SAP solutions and advising the IT department of clients on what is best for them and then helping them implement it. Your end customers in this case is always IT department people. This is purely technical job ðŸ˜€ Folks who work in this area are called technology consultants. On the first day of project you can recognize these guys as someone who is wearing a suit but is uncomfortable in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business consulting&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; understanding the capabilities of SAP&amp;#8217;s solutions and implementing them for the client&amp;#8217;s business. For example let us say you manufacture bulbs &amp;#8211; you have plants where you make them, you have suppliers who supply you materials, you have distributors who distribute your products and finally you have customers. Also don&amp;#8217;t forget the employees. So you implement SAP solutions which take care of all these folks and the processes they are involved in. People who work in these areas are called functional consultants and they love to wear suits ðŸ˜€&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution Delivery&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; both of the above activities could involve multi-month engagement with the end clients with a team of functional as well as technology consultants. This engagement would be called a project. There are folks whose main job is to deliver the on time within budget and scope delivery of these projects. These are your project managers. Usually PMs evolve organically from the above two roles. But you might see folks coming out of B-Schools directly jumping as PMs. This guy is a leader and can be seen very nervous during the first few days of the project ðŸ˜‰&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have decided one of the three above you can focus on a particular SAP product. I wrote this with SAP in mind but I think this would be true for any enterprise software product.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Back from SAP TechED 2007</title>
      <link>https://2pk.github.io/2007/10/back-from-sap-teched-2007/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pnarula.com/images/bt/BackfromSAPTechED2007_9DF1/techedsched.jpg&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://pnarula.com/images/bt/BackfromSAPTechED2007_9DF1/techedsched.jpg&#39;, &#39;&#39;]);&#34; &gt;&lt;img style=&#34;border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px&#34; height=&#34;239&#34; alt=&#34;teched-sched&#34; src=&#34;http://pnarula.com/images/bt/BackfromSAPTechED2007_9DF1/techedsched_thumb.jpg&#34; width=&#34;234&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Last night I landed back in San Jose on US Airways 162 which should have been dubbed rather TechED flight. I am sure more than 50% folks were returning from Mandalay Bay. It was easily the biggest TechED so far with 6000 folks from all over the US, quite a few from outside US too. Attending the sessions you like and managing the schedule can be a lot of work &amp;#8211; see right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;eSOA was the biggest theme this year and it was quite fun to participate in the Product Strategy workshops with Product Management folks. There were also quite a few sessions on Composition Environment. In fact Vishal Sikka&amp;#8217;s keynote demoed some parts of the CE. Some of the other interesting things&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pnarula.com/images/bt/BackfromSAPTechED2007_9DF1/blogged.jpg&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://pnarula.com/images/bt/BackfromSAPTechED2007_9DF1/blogged.jpg&#39;, &#39;&#39;]);&#34; &gt;&lt;img style=&#34;border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px&#34; height=&#34;53&#34; alt=&#34;blogged&#34; src=&#34;http://pnarula.com/images/bt/BackfromSAPTechED2007_9DF1/blogged_thumb.jpg&#34; width=&#34;142&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ADoW&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; ADoW or Application Delivery over WAN was announced &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fortybeans.com/index.php?itemid=6&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://www.fortybeans.com/index.php?itemid=6&#39;, &#39;last year&#39;]);&#34; &gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; and it was good to hear that SAP is using it internally for their portal. It is a software appliance to speed up the delivery of NetWeaver Applications over the long haul WANs like between continents and long distances. It is achieved by caching and bandwidth shaping etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;New&amp;#8221; Identity Management&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; is based on SAP&amp;#8217;s new acquisition Maxware. This will be very useful and powerful tool in SAP&amp;#8217;s portfolio. I can see this tool filling a lot of gaps I have seen on NetWeaver implementations. Virtual Directory Server (VDS) concept inside this tool is quite powerful. VDS can put a facade around most of the user stores like LDAP, DB, ABAP user stores. Right now this exists as a separate tool from NetWeaver. Hopefully SAP would be integrating this with NW pretty soon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtualization&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; is a recurrent theme which has been very hot in the last few years. VMWare and Intel were seen promoting this heavily and I attended a session on virtualization and Linux&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SDN Clubhouse&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Not a technical thing but IMO clubhouse was the most fun place to be between the sessions. Cappuccinos and Mochas were excellent. Met a lot of interesting folks over here. Good to see &lt;a href=&#34;http://craig.cmehil.com/&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://craig.cmehil.com/&#39;, &#39;Craig Cmehil&#39;]);&#34; &gt;Craig Cmehil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/sdn/weblogs?blog=/pub/u/8366&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;https://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/sdn/weblogs?blog=/pub/u/8366&#39;, &#39;Mario Herger&#39;]);&#34; &gt;Mario Herger&lt;/a&gt;, Irfan Khan and Kartik Iyengar. There were a lot of activities going on like SAP demos on the pods, community theater, 5 partner stalls with lots of ipod touches to give :), check your basis skills in the back etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall a fun and tiring TechEd. You can see a large collection of photos &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/groups/sapteched/pool/&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://www.flickr.com/groups/sapteched/pool/&#39;, &#39;on Flickr&#39;]);&#34; &gt;on Flickr&lt;/a&gt;. On Monday the first day I picked a lot of ribbons I associate with. Sticking them together and hanging under the badge would have made a nice necktie. But I chose to wear just the badge. Anyway here are the ribbons stuck together&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The coming of composites</title>
      <link>https://2pk.github.io/2005/10/the-coming-of-composites/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2005 20:36:44 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://2pk.github.io/2005/10/the-coming-of-composites/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Enterprise software has been of great interest to me since the college days. &lt;a href=&#34;http://123suds.blogspot.com/2005/10/enterprise-software-industry.html&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://123suds.blogspot.com/2005/10/enterprise-software-industry.html&#39;, &#39;Sadgopan&#39;]);&#34; &gt;Sadgopan&lt;/a&gt; who heads eBusiness and Consulting for &lt;a href=&#34;http://in.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SAY&amp;#038;d=0b&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://in.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SAY&amp;#038;d=0b&#39;, &#39;Satyam&#39;]);&#34; &gt;Satyam&lt;/a&gt; has written an excellent article on evolution of enterprise software and the direction it is going to take in future. He is musing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With globalization and a flat world increasingly beginning to force enterprises to become more competitive the business climate began to slowly change &amp;#8211; the new rule of the game demanded agility as the key driver for success in general &amp;#8211; &lt;strong&gt;the game changed and began to favor the fast moving against the slower one and big size did not necessarily confer advantages&lt;/strong&gt; on business entities by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do read it over here at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sandhill.com/opinion/daily_blog.php?id=15#post95&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://www.sandhill.com/opinion/daily_blog.php?id=15#post95&#39;, &#39;sandhill.com&#39;]);&#34; &gt;sandhill.com&lt;/a&gt;. He concludes that the enterprise software is moving towards composite applications made from mash-up of existing apps. My own take on the software evolution can be summarized in very few words &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First there were custom apps,&lt;br /&gt;
Then came COTS&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now is the age of the composite applications&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is more motivating in the story is validation of SAP&amp;#8217;s Netweaver Intiative. Being a Netweaver professional it makes me smile. Quoting Sadgopan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAP is said to be devoting as much as a third of its overall R&amp;amp;D efforts towards building composites &amp;amp; its roadmap promises to provide its customers with the ability to create new business processes on the fly &amp;amp; avoid any rebuilds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It tells you about the related stories, companies and concepts related to the present story. Immediately went and checked this &lt;a href=&#34;http://beta.news.com.com/SAP+opens+arms+to+NetWeaver+community/2100-1012_3-5884049.html&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://beta.news.com.com/SAP+opens+arms+to+NetWeaver+community/2100-1012_3-5884049.html&#39;, &#39;story&#39;]);&#34; &gt;story&lt;/a&gt;. See what the big picture is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#8217;t it interesting how SAP has Micorsoft, Oracle in its vicinity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>indiOne hotels by Tata Group</title>
      <link>https://2pk.github.io/2005/09/indione-hotels-by-tata-group/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2005 23:24:41 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://2pk.github.io/2005/09/indione-hotels-by-tata-group/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A nice hotel is a must for any business traveller. A good night at a decent hotel can do good for the business. As a SAP professional constantly on the road, I can associate with this. Just read over at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.emergic.org/archives/2005/09/21/index.html#tech_talk_building_a_better_india_and_the_good&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://www.emergic.org/archives/2005/09/21/index.html#tech_talk_building_a_better_india_and_the_good&#39;, &#39;Rajesh Jain&amp;#8217;s Emergic &#39;]);&#34; &gt;Rajesh Jain&amp;#8217;s Emergic &lt;/a&gt;about the new hotels from Tata group called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.indione.com/&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://www.indione.com/&#39;, &#39;indiOne&#39;]);&#34; &gt;indiOne&lt;/a&gt;. Rajesh has good things to say about this hotel. From the looks they look pretty decent. Have a dekho yourself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &amp;lt;img width=&amp;quot;162&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;157&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;http://www.indione.com/images/new_IO_SSR2.jpg&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img width=&amp;quot;162&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;157&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;http://www.indione.com/images/new_IO_SSR3.jpg&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice fact about the hotel is that first the price of the rooms was fixed and then the infrastructure was built backwards from there or as Rajesh puts it &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;bottom-up innovation&amp;#8221;.&lt;/strong&gt; For 1000 bucks a night this is great deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering SAP India is in the walking distance from there I might just land up there some day. If you are going to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sapteched.com/india/home.htm&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://www.sapteched.com/india/home.htm&#39;, &#39;SAP TechEd &amp;#8217;05 Bangalore&#39;]);&#34; title=&#34;SAP Teched Bangalore&#34;&gt;SAP TechEd &amp;#8217;05 Bangalore&lt;/a&gt;, this might be the place to spend your nights.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Et Tu Plumtree and end of pure play portal vendors</title>
      <link>https://2pk.github.io/2005/09/et-tu-plumtree-and-end-of-pure-play-portal-vendors/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2005 21:56:39 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://2pk.github.io/2005/09/et-tu-plumtree-and-end-of-pure-play-portal-vendors/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the rosy days of late nineties there were three pure portal play companies. Plumtree, Epicentric and Toptier. Then sometime in late 2000 SAP decided to complement there technology platform with a portal offering. They &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sap.com/company/investor/financialnews/adhoc/toptier01.epx&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://www.sap.com/company/investor/financialnews/adhoc/toptier01.epx&#39;, &#39;acquired Toptier&#39;]);&#34;  title=&#34;SAP acquires Topties&#34;&gt;acquired Toptier&lt;/a&gt; for whopping $400 millions and married it with their existing portal product called workplace. This was a great buy for SAP as the acquired product has now morphed in the very mature people layer of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sap.com/solutions/netweaver/enterpriseportal/index.epx&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://www.sap.com/solutions/netweaver/enterpriseportal/index.epx&#39;, &#39;SAP&amp;#8217;s Netweaver&#39;]);&#34;  title=&#34;Enterprise Portals&#34;&gt;SAP&amp;#8217;s Netweaver&lt;/a&gt; platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then somewhere in 2002 came Epicentric&amp;#8217;s turn and it got acquired by Vignette for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.internetnews.com/ent-news/article.php/1490541&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://www.internetnews.com/ent-news/article.php/1490541&#39;, &#39;$32 millions&#39;]);&#34;  title=&#34;Vignette acquires Epicentric&#34;&gt;$32 millions&lt;/a&gt;. Vignette complemented their content development platform with the content delivery platform via Epicentric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I read the news of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1851229,00.asp&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1851229,00.asp&#39;, &#39;Plumtree&amp;#8217;s acquisition by BEA&#39;]);&#34;  title=&#34;BEA acquires Plumtree&#34;&gt;Plumtree&amp;#8217;s acquisition by BEA&lt;/a&gt; via Phil Wainewright&amp;#8217;s excellent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.looselycoupled.com/blog/lc00aa00114.html&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://www.looselycoupled.com/blog/lc00aa00114.html&#39;, &#39;Loosely Coupled blog&#39;]);&#34;  title=&#34;BEA buys Plumtree&#34;&gt;Loosely Coupled blog&lt;/a&gt;. It is sad in the sense that there is no major Pure Play Portal vendor left in the field  &lt;img src=&#34;http://pnarula.com/wp/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png&#34; alt=&#34;:(&#34; class=&#34;wp-smiley&#34; style=&#34;height: 1em; max-height: 1em;&#34; /&gt;But does that mean being pure portal vendor is not viable in today&amp;#8217;s economic scenarios. You got to be an applications vendor and club portal as delivery platform. SAP has a whole slew of applications to be delivered via portal i.e. CRM, BW, HCM, SCM, and SRM etc. Vignette has while not a business application vendor has the content management system up its sleeve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives rise to the question what application does BEA has? But again BEA has been a pure technology platform vendor. What perplexed me as rightly pointed by Phil in LCBlog was the decision to keep BEA&amp;#8217;s existing portal separate from Plumtree stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We now have leadership in both transactional and collaboration portals&amp;#8221; Chuang said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Chuang and Carges stressed that BEA will maintain separate portal offerings. &amp;#8220;We will have two separate portal product lines for as long as we can see,&amp;#8221; Carges said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping both the products separate would mean more pain for the customers in maintaining and operating two separate stacks. It would be interesting to see how long both of the stacks remain separate from each and how they evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last a disclaimer I have been a SAP Portals consultant for the last four years and naturally I have a strond bias towards SAP Portal which I consider the best positioned platform sitting at the top in SAP&amp;#8217;s Netweaver Platform&amp;#8217;s People layer. Also it would have been more interesting if Oracle had bought Plumtree ðŸ˜€&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Something to watch for SAP and Linux</title>
      <link>https://2pk.github.io/2005/02/something-to-watch-for-sap-and-linux/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2005 01:14:39 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://2pk.github.io/2005/02/something-to-watch-for-sap-and-linux/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was smitten by Linux very early in my tech life. I still remember how long it took to configure X Windows on a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pec.ac.in/pages/org.htm&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://www.pec.ac.in/pages/org.htm&#39;, &#39;CEL&#39;]);&#34; &gt;CEL&lt;/a&gt; machine in the summer of 95. SAP also has a special initiative for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sap.com/linux/&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://www.sap.com/linux/&#39;, &#39;linux&#39;]);&#34; &gt;linux&lt;/a&gt; It pleased me to read about German Railways migration to linux over &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/os/linux/story/0,10801,99522,00.html?source=x10&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/os/linux/story/0,10801,99522,00.html?source=x10&#39;, &#39;here&#39;]);&#34; &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. What got me more interested was this snippet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has already shifted its vital train timetabling system from HP Non-Stop to Linux. Next, it will move various SAP systems, including sales support, from Unix to Linux. And by the end of the year, all remaining critical systems such as databases, application servers, Web servers, mail servers and network infrastructure will be running on Linux, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely some thing to watch for. Someday I want to do a detailed ROI analysis of SAP on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If something makes a news on Slashdot it has to belong to the kingdom of day-to-day geeks. Typically SAP professionals start getting the news about cool technologies brewing inside the tech giant thru various niche magazines and lately &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sdn.sap.com&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;https://www.sdn.sap.com&#39;, &#39;SDN&#39;]);&#34; &gt;SDN&lt;/a&gt;. I was excited to read &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sdn.sap.com/sdn/weblogs.sdn?blog=/pub/u/9217&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;https://www.sdn.sap.com/sdn/weblogs.sdn?blog=/pub/u/9217&#39;, &#39;Dagfinn Parnas&#39;]);&#34; &gt;Dagfinn Parnas&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s article &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sdn.sap.com/sdn/weblogs.sdn?blog=/pub/wlg/940&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;https://www.sdn.sap.com/sdn/weblogs.sdn?blog=/pub/wlg/940&#39;, &#39;SAP Virtual Machine Container (as seen on TechEd)&#39;]);&#34; &gt;SAP Virtual Machine Container (as seen on TechEd)&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing an article about &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.javadevelopersjournal.com/story/?storyid=47362&amp;#038;de=1&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://www.javadevelopersjournal.com/story/?storyid=47362&amp;#038;de=1&#39;, &#39;A Java Server That Never Goes Down&#39;]);&#34; &gt;A Java Server That Never Goes Down&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; is pure hubris, but a German developer who says he&amp;#8217;s been &amp;#8220;eating, sleeping, and drinking Java&amp;#8221; for 8 years doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to care and his article brings to light the aspects of VM we rarely think of as he introduces &amp;#8220;user isolation&amp;#8221; and tells about some interesting work SAP in Germany is doing in that area, merging the Java and the ABAP worlds.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got a nice Diwali greeting from someone at SAP. I love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pnarula.com/images/bt/sap-greeting.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;SAP Greeting&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I too have been sending HTML greetings over the years. What I liked about this one was the right header, content and footer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can use the SAP Web Application Server to develop Web applications that are based on the Internet Communication Framework and the HTTP request handler IF_HTTP_EXT_BSP. These Web applications are also known as BSP applications (Business Server Page applications).

I really like the refrigerator analogy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Market studies have shown that up to 50% of portal project fail not because of technical issues, but because the portals couldn&amp;#8217;t attract users or get them to come back. It&amp;#8217;s like an &lt;strong&gt;empty refrigerator&lt;/strong&gt;, it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter how great the refrigerator is when there are only a few stale items inside.
  &lt;/p&gt;

    SAP said it will be responsible for installing the full range of the flagship MySAP product line at Pepsi, including enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM) and supply chain management tools. SAP said the effort is aimed at unifying all the legacy software systems used in Pepsi&amp;#8217;s many divisions, including Frito-Lay, Quaker Oats and the Pepsi Bottling Group.

      <title>The Giant is opening up</title>
      <link>https://2pk.github.io/2004/06/the-giant-is-opening-up/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 06 Jun 2004 20:04:35 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://2pk.github.io/2004/06/the-giant-is-opening-up/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How do you let the world know all the cool technologies and solutions you are brewing up. By opening up more. That is what has been happening in the SAP world for the last couple of years. There was a time when the only public way to access information about SAP was through their website. There were few enthusiast websites but limited in content. This is changing now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all there is &lt;a href=&#34;http://sap.com/community&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://sap.com/community&#39;, &#39;SAP Community&#39;]);&#34; &gt;SAP Community&lt;/a&gt; site. So many interesting discussions happen in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://sap.com/community/pub/forums.aspx&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://sap.com/community/pub/forums.aspx&#39;, &#39;forums&#39;]);&#34; &gt;forums&lt;/a&gt;. Then there are &lt;a href=&#34;http://sap.com/community/pub/blogs.aspx&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://sap.com/community/pub/blogs.aspx&#39;, &#39;executive blogs&#39;]);&#34; &gt;executive blogs&lt;/a&gt; where you can read about vision and what is in the executive&amp;#8217;s minds. They always have some cool freebie for the members as a part of their rewards program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the more technically inclined geek heads their is &lt;a href=&#34;http://sdn.sap.com&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://sdn.sap.com&#39;, &#39;SAP Developer Network&#39;]);&#34; &gt;SAP Developer Network&lt;/a&gt;(SDN). You will find content areas for the complete technology stack. Netweaver, Enterprise Portals, Business Intelligence, and WebDynpro all are their. For consultants like me discussion forums is a great thing. Then there are weblogs where &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.futuresalon.org/2004/04/mavens_and_conn.html&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://www.futuresalon.org/2004/04/mavens_and_conn.html&#39;, &#39;mavens&#39;]);&#34; &gt;mavens&lt;/a&gt;(Thanks &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.finnern.com/stories/2002/08/09/uebermark2.html&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://www.finnern.com/stories/2002/08/09/uebermark2.html&#39;, &#39;Mark &#39;]);&#34; &gt;Mark &lt;/a&gt;for making me aware of this term) can write to their hearts desire. While over there don&amp;#8217;t forget to check DevToday based on the ViewPoint technology. It is contextual mining of content on steroids ðŸ˜€ Before I forget you do need the free registration to access these sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be a ÃƒÂ¼ber geek but you still need quick access to documentation. &lt;a href=&#34;http://help.sap.com&#34; onclick=&#34;_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-article&#39;, &#39;http://help.sap.com&#39;, &#39;Help portal&#39;]);&#34; &gt;Help portal&lt;/a&gt; just does the thing and with the help of trex search engine any help page is few click away. To top this all there are Best Practice guides also available on this help portal. These guides are the best qualitative knowledge you would find for implementing any solution from SAP.&lt;/p&gt;
